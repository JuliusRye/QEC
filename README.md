# QEC
A repo containing the code developed throughout my master thesis project on quantum error correction (QEC)

# Usage
Make a new python environment with ``python3 -m venv path/to/virtual/environment/location`` and install the packages in **requirements.txt** ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

# Used files
The files that where used for the final results in the project are all in the folder ``Modules``. The folder named ``DiscardedFiles`` are old versions of the code that have not been maintained.
